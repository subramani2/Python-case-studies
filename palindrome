Ash knows that I like palindromes a lot, so he has made a problem for me on palindromes. 
He will give me a string S and he has asked me to generate the longest subsequence of alphabets, and numbers 
(,i.e., one sequence for alphabets and another for numbers) and check whether they are palindrome or not.
I am busy with my study so I am asking you to solve this problem and enjoy.

import re
n=int(input())
new = lambda x:'Yes' if x==x[::-1] else 'No'
for a in range(n):
    new1=input()
    c=''.join([i for i in new1 if i.isalpha()])
    d=''.join([i for i in new1 if i.isdigit()])
    print(new(c),new(d))
